# Narrative-Data-Visualisation

As part of this data exploration project  I analysed and explored any existing relationships between the spread of COVID-19 rate in different countries and various health, economic or environmental attributes. the I aimed to answer mainly below questions.
1. Is there any relationship between the spread of COVID-19 and the median age of the countries impacted?
2. Is there any relationship between the spread of COVID-19 and the population density of the countries impacted?
3. Is there any relationship between the spread of COVID-19 and different health and governmental factors (i.e. smoking, life expectancy, Government spending on health)?

In the process I discovered some interesting trends and almost positive relationships in most of these factors with the spread of COVID-19 however some seemingly related more to the spread of the disease than others, the data sourced for this project is limited to the COVID-19 data from 9/1/20 - 12/4/20
The data exploration was done using Tableau and the App is built using R-Shiny
